    <p> Instead of buying new clothes, try thrifting! Thrifting is a great alternative to buying clothes and it won't hurt your bank account either. </p>

    <p> If you don't want too much clutter in your house but still want to hop on fashion, look into renting out clothes. Renting clothes can help buy the outfits of your dreams and still be sustainable. </p>
